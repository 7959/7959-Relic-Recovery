## Welcome to Team 7959's repository
This is the FTC team 7959's repository. We will work together to create a complex program to complete the FIRST Relic Recovery Challenge.
We come from Columbia High School in NJ, and hope to make it to world championships.

## Objectives
We hope to have our program have multiple features to increase efficiency, in completing the tasks autonomously.
* Use of Vuforia to process images from the phones camera.
* Basic decision making for the robot to decide what task to do and when.
* Ability to complete the tasks provided to us for the competition.

## For members of 7959
Hi! Welcome to the our github, there is a few things you have to do before starting to code.
First you have to install a java SDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Now you have to install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

Next, you have to download git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Finally you can install our code
*Open up Git Bash and select where you want to download it.
*Type in "git clone https://github.com/RobiHuq/7959-Relic-Recovery.git"

Now it is time to set it up on Android Sudio
*Open Android Studio and click import project, select the 7959-Relic-Recovery folder and hit enter.
*After a little bit of loading you should get and error and a message suggesting certain plugins to download.
*Click this, and wait as your die of boredom from all this loading.

Your Android Studio should now be working!

You are now ready to code, but before you begin; Please talk to Robi about how to cooperate with the rest of the team using github!
